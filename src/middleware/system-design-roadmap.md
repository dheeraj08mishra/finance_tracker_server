## Tips for Success

### During Study
- **Focus on understanding, not memorization**
- **Always consider trade-offs** - No perfect solutions exist
- **Practice explaining your thinking** out loud
- **Draw diagrams** for everything
- **Time yourself** during practice sessions

### During Interviews
- **Clarify requirements** before starting design
- **Start with high-level architecture**
- **Discuss trade-offs** explicitly
- **Consider scalability** from the beginning
- **Ask questions** throughout the process
- **Be honest** about what you don't know

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Jumping into details too quickly
- Not considering data storage early enough
- Ignoring reliability and fault tolerance
- Over-engineering solutions
- Not discussing monitoring and observability
- Forgetting about security considerations

**Remember**: System design is about demonstrating your thought process, not finding the "perfect" solution. Focus on clear communication, logical reasoning, and comprehensive thinking rather than memorizing specific architectures.

Good luck with your preparation! 🚀
